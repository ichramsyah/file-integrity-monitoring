> **Disclaimer**: This project is for portfolio and showcase purposes only. It demonstrates the design and logic of a Distributed Host Integrity Monitoring Platform but requires additional hardening for production use.

## 📖 Overview

The **Distributed Host Integrity Monitoring Platform (DHIMP)** is a scalable security solution designed to monitor the integrity of files across multiple distributed servers from a single viewpoint.

The system uses a decentralized architecture where each monitored server functions as an independent unit containing its own **Agent** and **Backend Aggregator**. A **Centralized Dashboard** then connects to these distributed units, allowing administrators to monitor security events across the entire infrastructure through a single "Single Pane of Glass" interface.

## 🏗️ Architecture

Each monitored server operates as a self-contained unit (Agent + Backend + Infra). The Centralized Dashboard aggregates data from all these sources.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### 1. Deploying a Server Unit (Agent + Backend)

Run this on **each** server you want to monitor.

```bash
# 1. Clone & Configure Infra
cd infra
ansible-playbook -i inventory.ini deploy-backend.yml

# 2. Manual Start (if not using Ansible)
cd backend
docker-compose up -d --build
```

_This starts the Local Backend Aggregator (Gunicorn/Django) and Monitoring Stack (Prometheus/Grafana)._

### 2. Configure the Agent

On the same server, set up the agent to talk to the Local Backend.

```bash
cd agent
pip install -r requirements.txt
# Ensure agent.py points to http://localhost:8000/api
```

### 3. Deploy Centralized Dashboard

Run this once on your admin machine or central server.

```bash
cd frontend
cp .env.local.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local` to list all your monitored servers:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_MAIN=https://server1.com/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SERVER2=https://server2.com/api
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_SERVER3=https://server3.com/api
```

Start the dashboard:

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
# OR with Docker
docker build -t fim-dashboard . && docker run -p 3000:3000 fim-dashboard
```

## ⚠️ Notes

- Ensure the **Centralized Dashboard** has network access to the **Backend Aggregator** ports (default: 8000) on all monitored servers.
- Use HTTPS in production to secure the data in transit between Server Units and the Dashboard.
